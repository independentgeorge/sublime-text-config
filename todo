[ ] add project root to find in files by default
[ ] better find in files exclusion folder settings
[ ] rebind replace all (together with find all on same button?) (ctrl t is creates new tab)
[?] highlight matches as if find panel always open (not matching only whole word stuff)
[?] keep find panel open on find in files search?
=====================================
[keybind] ctrl+shift+t <> reopen last tab
[keybind] ctrl+w <> close tab
[keybind] ctrl+shift+w <> close tabs to the right
[terminus/setting] always open terminus in project root (only if no project at current file, or maybe if file not part of project)
---
[style] font_size++ in sidebar
[style] font_size++ in command palette (hmm, in a nested one, like view package file's list, is that package specific or general?)
[keybind] ctrl+space fucked up in python syntax
[keybind] remove keybindings of added packages!
[keybind] f10 show scope name
[keybind] toggle_case
[keybind] rebind [] () {}
[keybind] terminus reset + clear
[keybind] ??? change syntax
[keybind] ??? move file to group
[keybind] ??? fold tag (xml) attributes
---
[terminus/keybind/plugin] ctrl+shift+w that is reopening last closed tab must work on terminus
[terminus/keybind/plugin] mouse selection
[terminus/keybind/plugin] ctrl+shift+left/right caught by sublime, we want a terminal selection 
[terminus/setting/plugin] creating a new tab when not in project must inherit current cwd from the current terminal (as file's path works)
[terminus/style] padding since no line numbers (maybe add some generally, to any tab)
[terminus/style] disable "word wrap" -> set a min col width?
[terminus/style] tab colour should reflect bg colour... or some other kind of indicator


PLUGINS
[ ] all EventListeners that are on based on a setting must be ViewEventListeners
[ ] indent pasted text if _auto_convert_indentation on
[ ] indicator when swapping groups (like cursor line blink)
[ ] keep undo history after closing
[ ] start new windows in fullscreen (or same size as main window)
[ ] improve curly brackets auto pairing (simply wrap text that follows until a newline or same level indentation?), careful not to fuck (js) objects up
[ ] i know there is something bothering me about quote auto-pairing, when mixing ' and "
